Yestoday when I prepared to run a java code in my cellphone,I encountered a problem that stuck me for lots of time.
Running java  code needs source code to be compiled to .class bytecode with the javac command.
Java classes in the same package which state with `package what.my.package;` statement can be refered to each other without importing.
Static function in a public class can be called by other invoking process,the process will first construct an Object of that class,remember to put an constructor function in  class definity.
Using dx --dex --no-strict --output=out.jar classfiles to generate a jar file which can be invoked by the dalvik vm in the cellphone.
